### Do you know the difference between framework and library?
<br>

''' Library is a collection of code aimed at solving a certain type of problem.
A framework has ready-made functionality and usually already has a structure to be followed.
To differentiate: libraries are usually used by our code, while frameworks are usually used by our code.
In the library we need to create the base and flow, thus having more freedom, and in the framework we have all this structure ready, but less freedom for certain choices.'''
